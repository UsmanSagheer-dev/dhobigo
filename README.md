DhobiGo

DhobiGo is Pakistan's first InDrive-style laundry marketplace, integrating real-time bidding, chat, and Hybrid Pickup and Delivery Services. It allows customers to post laundry requests, Dhobis to bid competitively, and verified riders to handle pickup/delivery.

Our Main Objectives
Provide Customers with a cheap laundry service by introducing a real-time bidding system to provide them with different offers from different dhobis and a real-time chat system with a dhobi for negotiation and contact support regarding their clothes, with 100% traceability and laundry service at their doorsteps, by pickup and delivery of their clothes at their choice of location
Increasing existing Dhobi’s sales by letting them serve throughout the whole city rather than a specific local area, by providing them with pickup/delivery services and providing them with a Dashboard for a Paperless store management & analytics tool.
Empowering unemployed people to provide laundry services from their home (especially housewives) by becoming a dhobi on our platform through easy registration, or by becoming a rider for pickup/delivery services for our dhobis

Problem Statements and Their Solutions:
Customers pay too much for laundry because prices are fixed, non-transparent, and they have no way to compare or negotiate with local dhobis.
Real-time bidding system lets multiple dhobis compete → customers see the lowest offers instantly.  In-app chat enables direct negotiation & support. 100% order tracking + doorstep pickup/delivery at user-chosen location.
Traditional dhobis are stuck in one mohalla — they can’t reach customers across the city, lose orders to big chains, and waste time on manual record-keeping.
City-wide reach via verified riders → dhobis serve the entire metro area. Paperless Dashboard with sales analytics, order history, and digital payments → zero paperwork, faster growth.
Unemployed people (especially housewives) have laundry skills but no platform to earn from home.  Youth need flexible gig jobs but lack trusted opportunities
Easy 5-minute registration to become a home-based dhobi (ideal for housewives). Become a verified rider → flexible pickup/delivery jobs with daily payouts.
